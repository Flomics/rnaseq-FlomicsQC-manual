Welcome to FlomicsQC module documentation from the Flomics/rnaseq pipeline!
===================================================

Flomicsâ€™ **FlomicsQC module** was developed as an extra layer of QC to produce and agreggate all the necessary metrics for the interpretation of the quality of the samples of the `Flomics/RNAseq pipeline https://github.com/Flomics/rnaseq`_ . Multiple metrics were extracted directly from `MultiQC https://multiqc.info/`_, a software that agreggates QC metrics from multiple sources. The softwares that produce those metrics will be listed under the :doc:`List_of_QC_metrics`, along with the description of those metrics.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
