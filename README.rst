Read The Docs 16S amplicon pipeline manual
=======================================

This GitHub repo hosts the code to build the RTD manual of the 16S pipeline.

Read the manual here:

https://16s-metagenomics-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

In general, files outside `docs/source/` should not be modified if one wants to modify the contents of the manual. The files outside that folder have to do with the building process of the the RTD page, and thus only modified when knowing what is being done.
